**Instructions:** Read the following instructions carefully.

- You do not need to complete every question. Choose the learning targets that are most important for you and focus on those.
- **You must show ALL of your work in order to earn full credit on any of the learning targets.** 
-  You may use any calculator you wish, so long as it does not have communications abilities (e.g., iPods, iPads, smartphones, laptops, etc.) or symbolic manipulation capabilities (e.g., TI-89).
- You may not use any notes, notecards, books, formula sheets, etc.
- Feel free to ask any questions you want -- especially if instructions are unclear, or if you want advice about which learning targets to attempt.

\newpage

### Given information about a function (either a table of data or a graph), answer questions about its average and/or instantaneous rates of change. 



1. 
\newpage


### Sketch a graph that has specific behaviors at indicated points and intervals.

2. Sketch the graph of a function satisfying: $f(0) = 0$; $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$; and $f''(x) < 0$ for $x<0$ and $f''(x) > 0$ for $x>0$.

**Make sure to label your grid with an appropriate scale!**

\newpage

### Given the graph of a function, answer questions about the function, its derivative, and its second derivative.

3. Consider the graph of $f(x)$ below. At which of the marked value(s) of $x$, if any, is

	a. $f(x)$ greatest?
	b. $f(x)$ least?
	c. $f'(x)$ positive?
	d. $f'(x)$ negative?
	e. $f''(x)=0$?

	
**Note that there may be more than one answer.** You should clearly explain why your identified point satisfies the stated condition.

\newpage

### Use the limit definition to find the derivative function.

4. Recall that $f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$. Use the limit definition to calculate the derivative of $f(x) = x^2+2x+1$. Note: to earn credit, you are required to use the limit definition, but may check your work using appropriate derivative rules if you would like.


\newpage

### Use the central difference and other estimation techniques to answer questions about applications of the derivative.

5. The data below give an estimate for the population of the world, $P(t)$, in millions, where $t$ is measured in years and $t=0$ corresponds to the year 1900. Use a central difference to estimate $P'(70)$. Then interpret your answer in the context of the problem.

\begin{tabular}{lccccc}  \hline
$t$ (density) &  0 & 20 & 40 & 60 & 80  \\
$P(t)$ (speed)  & 1650 & 1860 & 2300 & 3040 & 4450  \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
 



\newpage

### Given the graph of the derivative, answer questions about the function, the first derivative, and the second derivative.

6. Consider the graph of a derivative below.

a. State an interval on which the **original function** is increasing.
b. State an interval on which the **original function** is decreasing.
c. Give the location of a point of inflection of the original function, or explain why none exist.

\newpage

### Given the graph of a function, determine the values of indicated limits.

7. 

\newpage

### Given the graph of a function, determine the $x$-values where the function is not continuous and the points where it is not differentiable.


8. 


\newpage

### Find a local linearization, use it to estimate the function at a nearby point, and answer questions about the accuracy of that estimate.


9. Given $f(x) = \ln(x)$, it is known that $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

	a. Calculate the local linearization $L(x)$ at $a=1$.
	
	b. Use your answer from part (a) to estimate $\ln(0.9)$. 
	
	
\newpage

### Find the equation of a tangent line.

10. Find the equation of the line tangent to $g(x)$ at $x=5$ if $g'(5) = 4$ and $g(5)= -3$.

\newpage 

### Given information about two or more functions (either graphs or values, but not the equations), answer questions about new functions involving those functions and their derivatives.

11. Values of $f, f', g$, and $g'$ are given in the table. Let $u(x) = f(g(x))$ and $v(x) = f(x)/g(x)$.



a. Find $u'(1)$.


b. Find $v'(3)$.



\begin{table}[htp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}  
 &  $f(x)$ & $f'(x)$ & $g(x)$ & $g'(x)$  \\\hline
$x=1$ &  3 & 4 & 2 & $6$   \\
$x=2$  & 1 & 5 & 8 & $7$  \\
$x=3$  & 7 & 7 & 2 & $9$  \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\newpage

### Find $dy/dx$ for a function given implicitly.

12. Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ given $e^{x-y} = 2x^2 - y^2$.

\newpage

### Use L’Hopital’s Rule to evaluate limits involving indeterminate forms.

13. Calculate $\lim\limits_{x\to \pi/2} \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}$.
